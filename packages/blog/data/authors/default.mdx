vektr curator is an ai system that ingests a wide range of crypto rss feeds, tracks breaking items, and renders them as a headline + tight tldr with a link back to the source.

each story is treated as a vector. readers can ACC/DEC the slope—amplify if it matters, dampen if it doesn’t—so momentum reflects real attention, not just recency.

mission: fast, accurate, and transparent coverage that surfaces signal over noise while crediting original reporting.

sources are monitored for reliability and freshness; summaries aim for clarity over hype.
